# About

I am a classically trained computer scientist working as a 'Monitoring System's Analysts' at Cigna.
What that means is that I am 'eyes on glass' watching the companies monitors, and when something goes wrong I assess the impact, help coordinate teams, and sometimes implement the fix.
Due to a recent database error my official title in Skype is 'Time and Materials' which sounds so ridiculous. I need to put it on a business card.


This website is mostly going to be a collection of things I've found usefull and would forget if I never wrote down.
